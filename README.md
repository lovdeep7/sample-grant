#sample-grant


This is a sample grant hooked up to a game7 summon quest. Contributing to this repo will allow the users to test openstack on testnet and receive xp for their contributions. 

As an example, a DAO, Bounty, or Grant could set up a repository like this and point it to our quests on Summon. The community's DAO members can then contribute to the repository and meet the milestones outlined in the grant. After a fixed time period, the xp is distributed fairly within the community. External parties could also airdrop additional rewards beyond xp.
